# GNN

This repo contains a template of GraphSage model, in which the nodes do not have to have an initial feature. To achieve this, we use an Embedding network provided by PyTorch to get the initial features of nodes, which can be tuned during the training process. 

To run this code

```bash
python3 main.py
```
